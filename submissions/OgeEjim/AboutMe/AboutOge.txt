Hi 
My name is Oge, random facts about me; I like reading, swimming and touring, also my favourite colour is blue.  
Learning to code has not been easy for me, but im grateful for dufuna, and how approachable the people are.
This is a day that the lord has made, I must rejoice and be glad in it :-)(
I'm also a foodie, but I try to make healthy food choices.
